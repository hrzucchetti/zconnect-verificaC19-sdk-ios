## About SDK

This repository contains the source code of *ZConnectVerificaC19SDK*, SDK for iOS written in Swift based on [official it-dgc-verificac19-sdk-android](https://github.com/ministero-salute/it-dgc-verificac19-sdk-android). The repository is forked from the [official VerificaC19 App - iOS](https://github.com/ministero-salute/it-dgc-verificaC19-ios).

The SDK allows verifying DCCs using public keys from Italy backend servers. Offline verification is supported, if the latest public keys are present in the app's key store. Consequently, once up-to-date keys have been downloaded, the verification works without active internet connection.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- You need a Mac to run Xcode.
- Xcode 13+ is used for our builds. The OS requirement is macOS 11.0+.
- Service Endpoints:
  - This Library talks to the endpoint: `https://get.dgc.gov.it/v1/dgc/` to retrieve kids, public keys, settings and medical rules for prod configuration,
  - To get QR Codes for testing, you might want to check out `https://dgc.a-sit.at/ehn/testsuite`.

### Swift Package Manager
You can add this SDK as a package dependecy by using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) tool which is already integrated into the `swift` compiler.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/hrzucchetti/zconnect-verificaC19-sdk-ios.git", 
        .branch("release/latest")
    )
]
```
## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in the project by the verifier SDK and the core app and are imported as Swift Packages:
- **[SwiftDGC](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-app-core-ios).** Eurpean core library that contains business logic to decode data from QR code payload and performs technical validations (i.e. correct signature verification, signature expiration verification, correct payload format etc).
- **[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire).** Library used for networking.
- **[JSONSchema](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/JSONSchema.swift).** Library used by core module to validate DCC payload JSON schema.
- **[SwiftCBOR](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/SwiftCBOR).** Library used by core module for CBOR specification implementation.
- **[SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON).** Library used by core module to translate data from JSON format.

### Usage
Use DataSynchronizer class to fetch data from backend\
**Ensure you are calling sync method at least every 24 hours to keep rules settings and signature keys up to date**
```swift
    let synchronizer = DataSynchronizer()
    synchronizer.sync { result in
        switch result {
        case .updated:
            break
        case .sdkOutdated:
            break
        case .error(let error):
            break
        }
    }
```
    
Use Certificate class to get a simplified model of certificate content
```swift
    let certificate: Certificate? = Certificate(from: qrCodeContent)
```

Use this function to choose what scan mode is enabled:
- scanMode3G = Green Pass "base"
- scanMode2G = Green Pass "rafforzato"
- scanModeBooster = Green Pass "rafforzato" + test o dose booster
- scanModeSchool = Green Pass with school rules
```swift
    CertificateValidator.setScanMode(.scanMode2G)
```

Use CertificateValidator class to get a simplified status of given certificate. CertificateValidator can be instantiated by one of the following initializers
```swift
    let validator = CertificateValidator(payload: qrCodeContent)

    let validator = CertificateValidator(certificate: certificate!)
```    

Call validate method and give a success handler to get the certificate status
```swift
    validator.validate(onSuccessHandler: { status in
        switch status {
        case .valid:
            //is valid
            break
        case .notValid, .notGreenPass:
            //not is valid
            break
        }
    })
```
